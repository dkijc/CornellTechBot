# Cornell Tech Bot via Slack

Hello~ I am a project that has begun out of pain Cornell Tech students have experienced when they joined the school

Information like:

- admission 'Things to do'
- upcoming events
- student organized events
- faculty organized events

are coming from all different sources and it's difficult for the busy students to keep up with all these events. It doesn't help the fact that there is no place for the students to simply go to check upcoming events.

I want to help the students to easily find and attend upcoming events (social and career related). I thought, what if I can be an assistant to:

- notify upcoming events
- consolidate all google documents created by students and/or faculty so it's easily searchable
    - allow students to add info to google doc for an event
- NLP to help users (yea.. I know.. way in the future ^^;)

But for now... I want my self to greet with the user that contacts me.

Until then.. see you soon!

**MarinaBot (Marina)**

- Easily search our confluence page without going on it. (“/MarinaBot Can I get the resume template?”)
- Collect event feedback and email Marina!
 
**SocialBot (Me for now)**
- Help Cornell Students create .ical events on the fly
- Start tech topic of the day like #blockchain, to spur conversation and meeting with people online. 
    - Like “What’s everyone’s favorite - editor?!?” or “Whoah! Walmart is acquiring Bonobos! What do you guys think?” 
- Help Book Rooms when on campus

Additional future plans:

**John Kroll** has mentioned to me that students wished they knew each other better.
Could do something like #FollowFriday on Twitter, where there is a recommendation for someone to follow someone else every Friday. e.g. #StudentStorySaturday, where someone talks a bit about their life on Slack.  Stanford has a program like this called TALK (every Wednesday, one student shares their life story with the others in a single room)
